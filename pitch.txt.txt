Shoot the words

Game idea:

I wanted to make a game that would be fun and that would improve your typing at the same time. 
In this scrolling world game, the protagonist is a spaceship who is wandering around in space and the antagonists are the floating letters and words that will crash into the spaceship, destroying it.
To destroy them, the player will have shoot lasers at them by typing the incoming letters and the words. The way to win the game, is by finishing all 5 levels. 

The game will progressively get harder and harder.
In the first stage, their will only be letters to destroy. 
In the second stage, their will be short words.
In the third stage, their will be both letters and short words.
In the fourth stage, their will only be medium sized words.
And finally, in the final stage, their will be long words, medium sized words and also short words.

My main source of inspiration is the game "Typing Attack" on the internet.

I am looking for hard working and reliable teammates who can not only welcome feedback and advice but also give some in return.
